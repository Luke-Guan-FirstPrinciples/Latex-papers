   \abstract{A prominent jet-driven outflow of CO(2--1) molecular gas is found along the kinematic minor axis of the Seyfert 2 galaxy \mbox{ESO\,420-G13}, at a distance of $340$--$600\, \rm{pc}$ from the nucleus. The wind morphology resembles a characteristic funnel shape, formed by a highly collimated filamentary emission at the base, likely tracing the jet propagation through a tenuous medium, until a bifurcation point at $440\, \rm{pc}$ where the jet hits a dense molecular core and shatters, dispersing the molecular gas into several clumps and filaments within the expansion cone. We also trace the jet in ionised gas within the inner $\lesssim 340\, \rm{pc}$ using the \neii \ line emission, where the molecular gas follows a circular rotation pattern. The wind outflow carries a mass of $\sim 8 \times 10^6\, \rm{M_\odot}$ at an average wind projected speed of $\sim 160\, \rm{\kms}$, which implies a mass outflow rate of $\sim 14\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. Based on the structure of the outflow and the budget of energy and momentum, we discard radiation pressure from the active nucleus, star formation, and supernovae as possible launching mechanisms. ESO\,420-G13 is the second case after NGC\,1377 where the presence of a previously unknown jet is revealed due to its interaction with the interstellar medium, suggesting that unknown jets in feeble radio nuclei might be more common than expected. Two possible jet-cloud configurations are discussed to explain the presence of an outflow at such distance from the AGN. The outflowing gas will likely not escape, thus a delay in the star formation rather than quenching is expected from this interaction, while the feedback effect would be confined within the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy.}

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

Feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been invoked to ease the tension between cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and observations across all redshifts. Massive and fast outflows are rather common among luminous AGN, being detected in different gas phases and physical scales: from parsec-scale ultra-fast ($0.1\, \rm{c}$) outflows in X-rays to kpc-scale winds detected in atomic, molecular and ionised gas with velocities reaching or even exceeding $1000\, \rm{\kms}$ (e.g. \citeads{2017A&A...601A.143F}). By removing and/or heating the inter-stellar medium (ISM) such outflows may be able to suppress the star formation in the host galaxy. Indeed, simulations of massive galaxy formation in the past 15 years rely on the feedback effect from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to reproduce the properties of massive galaxies observed in the local Universe (\citeads{2005ApJ...620L..79S,2006MNRAS.370..645B,2006MNRAS.365...11C,2012RAA....12..917S,2013MNRAS.433.3297D,2015MNRAS.449.4105C,2015ARA&A..53...51S,2018MNRAS.479.4056W}). From the observational point of view, however, it has yet to be established the overall impact that AGN-driven outflows cause to the star formation in their host galaxies.

Vast observational efforts in the last years have been dedicated to the detection and characterisation AGN winds in molecular gas (e.g. \citeads{2012A&A...543A..99C,2014A&A...562A..21C,2010A&A...518L.155F,2013A&A...549A..51F,2013ApJ...775..127S,2014A&A...565A..46D,2015A&A...580A..35G,2017A&A...601A.143F,2018ApJ...863..143C,2018ApJ...859..144A,2019MNRAS.483.4586F,2019ApJ...875L...8R,2019arXiv190401483F}), producing a relatively large collection of individual sources. Recently, a compilation of 45 galaxies analysed by \citetads{2019MNRAS.483.4586F} showed that the outflow mass is largely dominated by the molecular and neutral gas in AGN galaxies, revealing also that the presence of an AGN strongly boost the mass outflow rates. However, essential aspects such as the overall occurrence of outflows in AGN host galaxies and the driving mechanisms of such outflows still remain unclear. In particular, the role of jets among moderate- to low-luminosity AGN is not understood. Some examples where the presence of a jet is required to launch the observed outflows are NGC\,1266 \citepads{2011ApJ...735...88A,2013ApJ...779..173N}, NGC\,1068 \citepads{2014A&A...567A.125G}, IC\,5063 \citepads{2015A&A...580A...1M,2016A&A...595L...7D}, and NGC\,5643 \citepads{2018ApJ...859..144A}. A clearer case was found in NGC\,1377, due to the collimated morphology of the molecular gas wind \citepads{2012A&A...546A..68A}. According to theoretical predictions, jets are very efficient at delivering a large amount of energy and momentum at large distances from the active nucleus (e.g. \citeads{2012ApJ...757..136W,2012ARA&A..50..455F}). However, jet-driven outflows were identified by \citetads{2019MNRAS.483.4586F} only in a few powerful radio-loud AGN in their sample.

\end{figure*}

A systematic survey of outflows in a representative sample of galaxies is required to determine the occurrence of this phenomenon and to probe the overall impact of feeding and feedback in AGN, spanning a luminosity range that brackets the knee of the AGN luminosity function. While this is the aim of our ALMA ``Twelve micron sample WInd STatistics'' (TWIST) survey (see Section\,\ref{twist}), in this study we report the first outflow detected in the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy ESO\,420-G13, a Southern target (\mbox{$\alpha\,=\,\rm{04^{h}\,13^{m}\,49.7^{s}}$}, \mbox{$\delta\,=\,\rm{-32^{d}\,00^{m}\,25^{s}}$}) located at $D = 49.4\, \rm{Mpc}$\footnote{Flat-$\Lambda$CDM, $H_0 = 73\, \rm{\kms\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.27$, $z = 0.01205$ (this work).}. This object has been classified as a Luminous InfraRed Galaxy (LIRG; $L_{\rm FIR} \sim 10^{11}\, \rm{L_\odot}$, \citeads{2003AJ....126.1607S}), showing a composite spectrum within the inner $1\, \rm{kpc}$ with a mixed contribution from Seyfert 2 emission and a post-starburst component, the latter characterised by an A-star dominant continuum \citepads{2017ApJS..232...11T}. On the other hand, the optical and near-infrared (near-IR) morphology is rather characteristic of an early type SA0 galaxy, with nuclear dusty spirals revealed in the mid-IR continuum \citepads{2014MNRAS.439.1648A}. For an integrated \textit{K}~band magnitude of $9.51 \pm 0.08\, \rm{mag}$ taken from the \textit{HyperLeda}\footnote{\url{http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr}} database \citepads{2014A&A...570A..13M}, we estimate a supermassive black hole mass of about $M_{\rm BH} \sim 4 \times 10^8\, \rm{M_\odot}$, using the correlation in \citetads{2013ARA&A..51..511K}. Regarding the star formation, we derive a $SFR = 6.1 \pm 0.6\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$, using the PAH $11.3 \, \rm{\micron}$ flux given by \citetads{2014ApJ...790..124S} and the calibration by \citetads{2012ApJ...746..168D}, close to the $\sim 12\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ derived from the \cii \ emission \citepads{2014A&A...568A..62D,2014ApJ...790...15S}. A solid evidence for the presence of an AGN comes from the detection of high-excitation mid-IR fine-structure lines in the \textit{Spitzer}/IRS spectra of ESO\,420-G13 \citepads{2015ApJS..218...21L}, since photoionisation by stars drops abruptly after the helium ionisation edge at $54\, \rm{eV}$ and thus cannot produce a significant amount of lines such as [\ion{Ne}{v}]$_{\rm 14.3, 24.3 \mu m}$ with $97.12\, \rm{eV}$ and \oiv \ with $54.94\, \rm{eV}$ (e.g. \citeads{2005ApJ...633..706W,2006ApJ...640..204A,2009MNRAS.398.1165G}). At radio wavelengths there is bright non-resolved emission within the inner $< 17''$ \citepads{1996ApJS..103...81C,1998AJ....115.1693C}. Still, ESO\,420-G13 show a IR-to-radio ratio of $q_{\rm IR} = 2.7$ (this work; $q_{\rm IR}$ definition from \citeads{2010MNRAS.402..245I,2019MNRAS.483.4586F}), typical of starburst galaxies, while powerful radio-loud galaxies have $q_{\rm IR} \lesssim 1.8$. In the X-rays, \citetads{2018A&A...620A.140T} found a slight excess at $6.4\, \rm{keV}$, but could not confirm the presence of a Fe\,K$\alpha$ line. The faint luminosity ($L_{\rm 2-10 keV} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{40}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$), the low absorption column estimate ($N_{\rm H} \sim 6 \times 10^{21}\, \rm{cm^{-2}}$), and the steep slope of $\Gamma \sim 3$ in the $2$--$7\, \rm{keV}$ continuum range suggest that the X-ray emission might be dominated by star formation while the AGN remains obscured in this range. No CO(1--0) emission was detected above a $3 \sigma$ level of $0.7\, \rm{Jy}$ in previous single dish observations by \citetads{1996A&AS..115..439E}, which corresponds to $< 180\, \rm{Jy\,\kms}$ assuming a total line width of $250\, \rm{\kms}$ for the unresolved galaxy, or $M_{\rm H_2} \lesssim 10^9\, \rm{M_\odot}$ using the \citetads{1997ApJ...478..144S} formula with $\alpha = 0.8\, \rm{M_\odot\,(K\,\kms\,pc^2)^{-1}}$ for the ISM of active star-forming galaxies \citepads{2013ARA&A..51..207B}.

This work is organised as follows. Observations and data reduction are detailed in Section\,\ref{obs}, the properties of the detected outflow are characterised in Section\,\ref{results}. The main results are discussed in Section\,\ref{discuss}, and the final conclusions are presented in Section\,\ref{sum}.

\section{Observations}\label{obs}

\subsection{A source from the TWIST survey}\label{twist}
ESO\,420-G13 is one of the galaxies included in the Twelve micron WInd STatistics (TWIST) project (Fern\'andez-Ontiveros et al. in prep.), a CO(2--1) molecular gas survey of 41 galaxies drawn from the $12$ micron sample \citepads{1993ApJS...89....1R}. Half of the sample was acquired in $27\,\rm{h}$ of observing time with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) interferometer (PI: \mbox{M. Malkan}; Programme IDs: 2017.1.00236.S, 2018.1.00366.S), located at Llano de Chajnantor (Chile), while the other half corresponds to data available in the ALMA scientific archive. The TWIST sample covers the knee of the $12\, \rm{\micron}$ luminosity function of Seyfert galaxies in the nearby Universe ($D = 10$--$50\, \rm{Mpc}$), and thus the results obtained from TWIST will be representative of the bulk population of active galaxies. This is crucial to quantify the global AGN feeding and feedback and measure the time-averaged impact of these processes.

\subsection{ALMA millimetre interferomery}

ESO\,420-G13 was observed with ALMA on December 8th, 2017 using the 12\,m array (PI: \mbox{M. Malkan}; Programme ID: 2017.1.00236.S). The spectral setup was optimised for the CO(2--1) transition line in band 6, at $230.5380\, \rm{GHz}$ rest frequency (excitation temperature $T_{\rm ex} = 16.6\, \rm{K}$, critical density $n_{\rm crit} = 2.7 \times 10^3\, \rm{cm^{-3}}$), which was selected as an optimal mass tracer in terms of angular resolution and sensitivity. A velocity channel width of $2.4\, \rm{\kms}$ and a total bandwidth of $2467\, \rm{\kms}$ were selected for the correlator setup. Additionally, two continuum bands at $\sim 1.2\, \rm{mm}$ were acquired to trace the cold dust continuum, and a spectral band centred on the CS(5--4) at $244.9356\, \rm{GHz}$. This line (with $T_{\rm Eup} = 35.3\, \rm{K}$) traces denser gas and has a critical density typically three orders of magnitude higher than the CO(2--1) line. The data were calibrated using the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (\textsc{casa}), pipeline v5.1.1-5, and the scripts provided by the observatory. These included the flagging of four antennae due to either a bad value in the system temperature ($T_{\rm sys}$), amplitude outliers, or a spike in $T_{\rm sys}$. Imaging and post-processing were done using our own scripts under \textsc{casa} v5.4.0-70. The image reconstruction was performed using the standard \texttt{hogbom} deconvolution algorithm with \texttt{briggs} weighting and a robustness value of $2.0$. This is equivalent to using natural weighting for the image reconstruction, and allows us to recover extended flux that might be filtered for lower robustness values, which give a larger weight to the most extended baselines. The beam size in the CO(2--1) spectral window is $0\farcs11 \times 0\farcs14$ at a position angle of PA\,$= 108\fdg5$, which corresponds to $26.3 \times 33.5\, \rm{pc^2}$ at a distance of $49.4\, \rm{Mpc}$. The field-of-view (FOV) has a diameter of $27''$ ($\approx 6\, \rm{kpc}$) and was covered using a single pointing. The largest angular scale that could be resolved in this antennae configuration is $0\farcs8$ ($\sim 190\, \rm{pc}$). Average continuum images were also obtained for each of the two frequency side-bands, discarding those channels with either CO(2--1) or CS(5--4) emission line detection. The masking procedure for the continuum data was run interactively during the cleaning process. Additionally, a deeper continuum image at $\sim 240\, \rm{GHz}$ ($1.2 \, \rm{mm}$) was obtained by combining all the continuum channels within the four spectral windows (left panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_zoom} and upper left panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments}). The spectral datacubes of the emission lines were produced with a channel with of $\sim 10\, \rm{\kms}$ and a pixel size of $0\farcs02$. The emission line regions were automatically masked during the cleaning process in the spectral cubes using the ``auto-multithresh'' algorithm in \texttt{tclean}. The continuum emission was then subtracted in the spatial frequency domain --\,i.e. prior to the image reconstruction\,-- using a zero degree polynomial between the adjacent continuum channels at both sides of the respective emission lines. Finally, the datacubes were corrected for the attenuation pattern of the primary beam. The rms sensitivity of the processed cubes is $0.02\, \rm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$ in continuum and $0.5\, \rm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$ for a $10\, \rm{\kms}$ line width.


\subsection{Mid-infrared narrow-band imaging}

ESO\,420-G13 was imaged using the VISIR\footnote{\textsc{Vlt} spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared \citepads{2004Msngr.117...12L}.} instrument, installed at the Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal (Chile) during the night of January 19th, 2006 (programme ID: 076.B-0696). These observations include two narrow-band filters in the \textit{N}~band, NEII ($\lambda_c = 12.81\, \rm{\micron}$, $\Delta \lambda = 0.21\, \rm{\micron}$) and NEII\_2 ($\lambda_c = 13.04\, \rm{\micron}$ $\Delta \lambda = 0.22\, \rm{\micron}$), which were acquired using a chopping throw of $10''$ and a pixel scale of $0\farcs127$. The final reduced images, processed using the VISIR pipeline delivered by ESO\footnote{European Southern Observatory.} as described in \citetads{2014MNRAS.439.1648A}, were taken directly from the SubArcSecond Mid-InfRared Atlas of Local AGN (SASMIRALA\footnote{\url{http://dc.g-vo.org/sasmirala}}). At a redshift of $z = 0.01205$ the NEII\_2 filter contains the \neii \ fine-structure line redshifted to $12.96\, \rm{\micron}$, while the adjacent NEII filter provides a measurement of the $\sim 12.5$--$12.7\, \rm{\micron}$ mid-infrared (mid-IR) continuum in the rest frame. Due to the similar width and transmission of the two narrow-band filters, we directly subtracted the continuum image from the line image. The difference in transmission between the two filters is of the order of the photometric error, i.e. about $5\%$ as measured for the associated calibrators in the SASMIRALA atlas. Due to the lack of reference stars in the VISIR FOV, a reliable astrometric calibration for the mid-IR images could not be obtained. Therefore, we assume the position of the bright mid-IR nucleus to be coincident with that of the compact nuclear continuum source in the ALMA $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ map.



\section{Results}\label{results}

At first sight ESO\,420-G13 resembles an early type galaxy in the \textit{Spitzer}/IRAC $3.6\, \rm{\micron}$ image (left panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_zoom}) with an inner kpc-size disc revealed by both warm and cold dust emission (right panel). The superior angular resolution of ALMA allows us to resolve the dust emission at $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ into three main components: a circumnuclear ring with $\sim 0\farcs8$ diameter ($190\, \rm{pc}$), an unresolved point-like source in the centre of this ring, and a kpc-size spiral structure. The latter is more prominent in the CO(2--1) intensity map (upper-right panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments}), where the cold molecular gas can be traced at radii up to $\sim 1.1\, \rm{kpc}$ away from the nucleus. The inner ring is presumably located at the inner Lindblad resonance, showing bright CO(2--1) emission possibly associated with active star formation. This is also the case for the bright $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ continuum spot on the North-East, which also has enhanced molecular gas emission. Inside the ring we detect diffuse line emission, however the lack of a bright knot in CO(2--1) is in contrast with the bright core found in the $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ continuum at the centre of the ring ($\sim 0.30 \pm 0.08\, \rm{mJy}$). This suggests that the millimetre radio emission from the nucleus could be non-thermal synchrotron radiation associated with the active nucleus. In this regard, a bright compact radio core was previously detected at $1.4\, \rm{GHz}$ by \citetads{1996ApJS..103...81C}, albeit at lower angular resolution ($17''$). Further radio observations at high-angular resolution would be required to probe the inner jet morphology and the synchrotron nature of the emission. The total CO(2--1) intensity integrated in the ALMA map is $260 \pm 2\, \rm{Jy\,\kms}$, which corresponds to a mass of $M_{\rm tot} = (3.07 \pm 0.02) \times 10^8\, \rm{M_\odot}$, assuming optically-thick gas and $\alpha = 0.8\, \rm{M_\odot\,(K\,\kms\,pc^2)^{-1}}$, as in LIRG and ULIRG galaxies \citepads{2013ARA&A..51..207B}. This is in agreement with the upper limit of $< 10^9\, \rm{M_\odot}$ derived from previous single-dish observations \citepads{1996A&AS..115..439E}. Faint CS(5--4) emission is detected in the nucleus ($1.3 \pm 0.2\, \rm{Jy\,\kms}$) and tentatively also in two molecular gas clumps in the spiral arms with integrated fluxes in the $0.3$--$0.5\, \rm{Jy\,\kms}$ range.

\subsection{A molecular gas wind}\label{CO_wind}
A remarkable wind has been detected thanks to its redshifted CO(2--1) emission extended along the kinematic minor axis of ESO\,420-G13, within the inner kpc of the galaxy. It can be clearly distinguished in the mean velocity and sigma moment maps obtained from the spectral cube and shown in the lower panels of Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments}. The wind extends from $\sim 1\farcs5$ to $2\farcs5$ away from the nucleus ($340\, \rm{pc}$ to $600\, \rm{pc}$) with projected velocities in the $+50$--$250\, \rm{\kms}$ range, and presumably indicates the orientation of the central engine axis. Its locus with respect to the systemic velocity ($3568 \pm 7\, \rm{\kms}$, this work) can be seen in the cube slices from $115$ to $190\, \rm{\kms}$ shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans}. The channel map reveals a characteristic funnel shape morphology (e.g. \citeads{2008ApJS..175..423P,2011ApJ...728...29W}), with a narrow filamentary emission starting at $\Delta \alpha = -0\farcs60$, $\Delta \delta = +1\farcs30$ ($340\, \rm{pc}$ projected distance), at $115\,\rm{\kms}$, elongated in the outflow direction, prior to a bifurcation point. The latter is probed by a bright spot in CO(2--1) emission at $130$ and $145\,\rm{\kms}$, located at $\Delta \alpha = -0\farcs80$, $\Delta \delta = +1\farcs65$ relative to the $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ continuum nucleus (pink marker in Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans}; $440\, \rm{pc}$ projected distance). At this forking point, the wind starts spreading further out perpendicularly to the direction of motion, developing a complex structure formed by filaments and several individual clouds that move faster along the cone axis and also with increasing distance from the nucleus. The width of the cone, measured in the direction perpendicular to the kinematic minor axis, ranges from the size of a beam/individual cloud ($\sim 20\, \rm{pc}$) up to $200\, \rm{pc}$ in its widest point. This morphology is also traced by the sigma map in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments} ($\sigma \sim 50\, \rm{\kms}$).

To determine the position angle (\textit{PA}) of the kinematic major and minor axes, we have modelled the galaxy rotation of the CO(2--1) gas using \textsc{DiskFit}\footnote{\url{https://www.physics.queensu.ca/Astro/people/Kristine_Spekkens/diskfit/}} \citepads{2015arXiv150907120S}. This code applies a $\chi^2$ minimisation to find a global model that fits the circular speed of the disc measured at different radii. In order to avoid over-fitting of non-axisymmetric components, only the rotation was considered here, thus radial flows or non-circular motions were not included in the fit. Furthermore we fixed the axis ratio at $b/a = 0.96$ (from NED\footnote{The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.} based on 2MASS images). The best-fit model has a \textit{PA}\,$= 57\fdg8 \pm 0\fdg1$ for the kinematic major axis, and a systemic velocity of $v_{\rm sys} = 3568 \pm 7\, \rm{\kms}$\footnote{Relativistic velocity, defined in the kinematic local standard of rest frame (LSRK).}. The rotation curve obtained is shown in the position-velocity (PV) diagram in Fig.\,\ref{fig_pvmaps} (pink line in top panel). The molecular gas motions within the innermost $r \lesssim 0\farcs4$ ($95\, \rm{pc}$) appear to be dominated by a nuclear ring or disc which coincides with the ring observed in both the dust continuum and the CO(2--1) intensity distribution (see insets in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments}). Outside of the ring, the velocities drop by $\sim 50\, \rm{\kms}$ from $r = 0\farcs4$ to $1''$ at both sides of the major axis, as shown by the upper panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_pvmaps}, to increase again up to $80$--$100\, \rm{\kms}$ at $\sim 1\farcs5$ from the nucleus. This is also evident in the mean velocity map in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments}. The secondary maxima in velocity occur at the intersection of the PV cuts along the major axis with the spiral arms, suggesting that streaming motions associated with the density waves in the galaxy disc alter the local velocity field in these regions.

The spectral profile of the total integrated CO(2--1) emission shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig_spec} (upper panel) is dominated by the galaxy rotation, which has a larger contribution to the intensity in the blue side of the profile. The outflow has a minor contribution to the integrated intensity ($\lesssim 3\%$), while it is easily identified in the slice of the CO(2--1) datacube along the kinematic minor axis (bottom panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_pvmaps}). 
The wind can be seen in the spectrum of a short slice extracted along the kinematic minor axis ($1'' < \Delta x < 3''$; orange dot-dashed line in Fig.\,\ref{fig_spec}, bottom-left panel), however the slit intersects only a small section of the outflow cone (see slit positions in the right panel of Fig.\,\ref{fig_spec}). Thus, the amplitude of the extracted spectrum is comparable to the interferometric artefacts in the map (see the negative residual at blueshifted velocities). An optimal extraction of the outflow spectrum can be performed using a 3D mask in the ALMA datacube, to select the outflow region in the spatial dimensions and isolate the wind from the rotating gas in the velocity dimension. The red contours in Figs\,\ref{fig_pvmaps} and \ref{fig_spec} represent the different projections of the 3D mask on the PV diagram and the image plane, respectively, while the integrated spectrum is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig_spec} (red-solid line). No counter outflow is detected at the blueshifted side of the kinematic minor axis ($-3'' < \Delta x < -1''$; blue-dashed line in Fig.\,\ref{fig_spec}) nor in the integrated spectrum of the opposite symmetric 3D mask (purple-dashed line). See Section\,\ref{discuss} for a further discussion on this issue.

The integrated wind emission ($7.0 \pm 0.6\, \rm{Jy\,\kms}$) translates into a molecular gas mass of $(8.3 \pm 0.7) \times 10^6\, \rm{\msun}$, derived from the \citetads{1997ApJ...478..144S} formula and $\alpha = 0.8\, \rm{M_\odot\,(K\,\kms\,pc^2)^{-1}}$, typical of LIRG and ULIRG galaxies \citepads{2013ARA&A..51..207B}. As no information on the excitation and optical depth of the gas in the wind is available, it is unclear whether other $\alpha$ values, such as those found for IC\,5063 \citepads{2016A&A...595L...7D}, could be appropriate. If instead a Milky Way value of $\alpha = 4.3\, \rm{M_\odot\,(K\,\kms\,pc^2)^{-1}}$ is assumed \citepads{2013ARA&A..51..207B}, the derived mass would be significantly larger, of $(4.5 \pm 0.4) \times 10^7\, \rm{\msun}$. For the case of optically thin emission, the wind mass would drop by a factor of $\sim 3$ (e.g. \citeads{2013A&A...558A.124C,2016A&A...595L...7D}).

\subsection{Extended ionised gas}\label{ion_wind}
The \neii \ emission-line contours above $3 \times$\,\textsc{rms} have been over-plotted on the moment maps in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments} and the channel maps in Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans}. The ionised gas distribution shows a central peak --\,possibly associated with the AGN\,-- plus an elongated plume with an extension of about $1''$ ($240\, \rm{pc}$) $3 \times$\,\textsc{rms} along the North-West direction, coincident with the kinematic minor axis. The orientation of the ionised gas emission is surprisingly well aligned with that of the CO(2--1) outflow, as best seen in e.g. the $115\, \rm{\kms}$ velocity slice (upper-left panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans}). The \textit{Spitzer}/IRS spectrum obtained by \citetads{2015ApJS..218...21L} suggests that the continuum filter is not affected by contamination from PAH or blueshifted \neii \ emission (see Fig.\,\ref{fig_ne2}).



At scales larger than the $3 \times 3\, \rm{kpc^2}$ covered by the ALMA observations, ESO\,420-G13 presents an extended tail of ionised gas towards the North-East and possibly the South-West, produced by the AGN and the star formation \citepads{2017ApJS..232...11T}. The far-IR lines observed by \textit{Herschel}/PACS \citepads{2016ApJS..226...19F} show a brighter distribution along the kinematic minor axis (e.g. see the [\ion{O}{i}]$_{\rm 63 \mu m}$, the [\ion{O}{iii}]$_{\rm 88 \mu m}$, and the [\ion{C}{ii}]$_{\rm 158 \mu m}$ maps in Fig.\,\ref{fig_o3_c2}). The lower angular resolution in the far-IR ($9\farcs4 \times 9\farcs4$ per spaxel vs. $1\farcs7$ seeing in the optical) does not explain this difference. No dust lanes that could explain this displacement are detected in the IRAC (Fig.\,\ref{fig_zoom}) or the 2MASS archival images. A more efficient cooling of the diffuse rarefied gas through the far-IR lines \citepads{O&F06} needs to be examined using observations at higher angular resolution.







\section{Discussion}\label{discuss}

\subsection{A wind revealing a jet}\label{windjet}
The results shown in Section\,\ref{results} point out to the detection of a jet-related wind in ESO\,420-G13, i.e., of a collimated outflow oriented along the minor axis of the galaxy and powered by the mechanical energy input from the AGN. In this picture, we interpret the extended \neii\ emission as a collimated ionised wind associated with hot gas in the jet cavity. The structure of the molecular gas outflow further out resembles closely that of numerical simulations of jet-cloud interactions \citepads{2011ApJ...728...29W,2016AN....337..167W}. The jet percolates the porous ISM propagating through a tenuous medium until it collides with a denser molecular core and splits, leading to the apparent bifurcation. Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans} shows a collimated, filamentary outflow starting at a projected distance of $340\, \rm{pc}$ from the nucleus and at relatively low velocities ($115\, \rm{\kms}$). At higher velocities, the outflow obtains a conical shape, with a starting point that is most likely associated with a dense jet-ISM impact point at $440\, \rm{pc}$. The exterior of the dispersed gas cone has lower projected velocities than the interior of the cone, which is sensible if, e.g., part of the jet remains in its initial trajectory. The dispersed gas also moves faster ($160$--$290\, \rm{\kms}$; Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans}) with increasing distance from the impact point, which is sensible if energy is mainly transported near the jet front. Inversely, the narrow side of the cone shows relatively high velocity dispersion ($\gtrsim 50\, \rm{\kms}$) when compared to the gas rotation ($\sim 20\, \rm{\kms}$), which could be explained by the effect of higher turbulence  \citepads{2012ApJ...757..136W} or higher ram pressure (in the case of a two-phase medium; \citeads{2010MNRAS.401....7H}) in the clouds that first experienced the jet impact. Overall, overpressured jets can inflate a bubble within the ISM, bifurcate and cause conical winds and disperse the molecular gas into several clumps and filaments \citepads{2012ApJ...757..136W}. This picture is similar to that seen in the galaxy IC\,5063 \citepads{2016A&A...595L...7D}.

The cases of NGC\,1377 and ESO\,420-G13 suggest that unresolved jets might still have an important role in the feeding process even for non powerful radio galaxies. In NGC\,1377 \citepads{2016A&A...590A..73A}, no radio emission was known at the time of the molecular wind detection. In ESO\,420-G13, faint radio emission was seen, but its origin could not be linked to a jet. The molecular wind suggests the presence of a jet, which was most likely unresolved in previous radio observations ($< 17''$; \citeads{1996ApJS..103...81C,1998AJ....115.1693C}). Overall, elusive jets like those seen in NGC\,1377 or ESO\,420-G13 can be detected through their interaction with the ISM. While in NGC\,1377 a continuous outflow can be traced from the nucleus up to a distance of $150\, \rm{pc}$ at both sides along the jet axis, in ESO\,420-G13 the molecular gas wind starts at $340\, \rm{pc}$ away from the nucleus, which could further strengthen the argument of the presence of a jet. At shorter radii the molecular gas shows regular rotation, while the morphology of the \neii \ emission suggests that and ionised wind might be present in the innermost few hundred parsecs. Future integral field spectroscopic observations at subarcsec resolution would be required to confirm the nature of the ionised wind. No counter-outflow is detected in the opposite direction of the redshifted molecular gas outflow. In the following Subsection, we propose geometries that could explain the jet-cloud interactions. 





\subsection{Jet-cloud configuration}\label{scenarios}
Two main scenarios are explored to explain how the observed outflow could be driven by jet-cloud interactions. First, we consider a jet close to the galaxy minor axis, colliding with a cloud located far from the galaxy plane. The non-detection of a blueshifted counterpart is reasonable, since the chance to find a molecular cloud at a relatively high altitude is low. The existence of such a cloud could even require out-of-equilibrium dynamical conditions, caused by e.g. by a previous feedback episode or by a minor merger in the past. A previous outflow event could have been launched by SNe, or by the AGN radiation, or by former jet activity, as in e.g. the case of Centaurus\,A \citepads{2016A&A...595A..65S}. In this scenario, the molecular gas would have reformed as the relic outflow cooled down \citepads{2018MNRAS.474.3673R}. Thus, the current jet event could push further away the same material that was ejected in the past. Alternatively, the minor merger scenario could be supported by the high IR luminosity in \mbox{ESO\,420-G13} ($\sim 10^{11}\, \rm{L_\odot}$) and the post-starburst features reported by \citetads{2017ApJS..232...11T} in the optical spectrum. This could also explain the existence of molecular gas clouds at a high altitude above the disc and the non-symmetric distribution of clouds in the opposite side. However, no stellar emission in the IRAC $3.6\, \rm{\micron}$ associated with the minor companion has been detected (see left panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_zoom}). With the current dataset, we deem the past feedback event more likely than the past minor merger event.

In the second scenario, the jet is pushing molecular gas that belongs to the (thick) galaxy disc, at an intrinsically low altitude. For a jet moving nearly parallel to the disk due to precession, as in the case of IC\,5063, the jet does not really shatter until it hits a dense molecular core at $340\, \rm{pc}$. At shorter radii the jet percolates the ISM through the inner circumnuclear ring, leading to the \neii \ emission in the low-density cavities. However, the outflow asymmetry is hard to justify. Otherwise, one can consider a jet emerging perpendicular to the galaxy disc, which then bents or precesses at a certain height and gets redirected towards the disc. This would explain why the innermost gas is unaffected. The \neii \ emission in this case would be also associated with the low-density ionised medium cone carved by the jet in the ISM. The one-sided wind would require an asymmetric jet bending, which is often observed in radio galaxies. However, the jet bending region is not identified in the CO(2--1) or the \neii \ line maps. If the jet bent was caused by precession, the symmetric counter-jet would have likely generated a blueshifted outflow, since the disc is rich in molecular gas near the expected impact point. If the jet bent was linked to a collision with a molecular cloud, then this cloud is small or destroyed and, thus, non-detectable.







\subsection{Energy and momentum balance}
Another argument favouring the jet scenario comes from the comparison of the wind kinetic luminosity and the radio power of ESO\,420-G13. The wind kinetic luminosity ($L_{\rm kin}$) was computed from the product $\frac{1}{2} M V^{3} d^{-1}$, where $M$ is the mass of the gas in the wind, $V$ is the wind speed measured as the average speed of the outflow spectrum in Fig.\,\ref{fig_spec} ($160\, \rm{\kms}$, projected velocity), and $d$ is the distance from the location of the driving mechanism. For a radio jet, this is equivalent to the jet-cloud impact point. In our computations, we always assume that the wind started away from the nucleus, not that it got transported from the nucleus to $\sim 340\, \rm{pc}$ away. Considering that the jet-ISM interaction occurs near the forking point of the outflowing CO(2--1) emission (Fig.\,\ref{fig_chans}), then the average projected distance covered by the wind is $d \sim 100\, \rm{pc}$ ($0\farcs4$). For an outflow mass of $(8.3 \pm 0.7) \times 10^6\, \rm{\msun}$ (see Section\,\ref{CO_wind}), we derive a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M} \sim M V/d = 14 \pm 1\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$, a kinetic luminosity of $L_{\rm kin} = 1.1 \times 10^{41}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, and a momentum rate of the accelerated gas of $\dot{M} V = 1.4 \times 10^{34}\, \rm{erg\,cm^{-1}}$. The error in the mass outflow rate corresponds only to the propagated uncertainty of the CO(2--1) intensity measurement, while a larger uncertainty is expected from the assumed geometry and the adopted $\alpha$ value. Furthermore, these values should be considered as lower limits due to the projection effect. If an inclination angle of $i \sim 20\degr$--$30\degr$ is assumed, then the deprojected velocity would be of about $320$--$470\, \rm{\kms}$, and the corresponding kinetic luminosity would be $\sim 4$--$9 \times 10^{41}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. Note that we are not including the velocity dispersion to define the average velocity of the wind, as has been done in e.g. \citetads{2019MNRAS.483.4586F}. Although this approach may be appropriate for a spherical wind, given the high collimation in our case we consider that including the turbulence of the wind would overestimate its average velocity.

We first compare these quantities with the kinetic and radiative power of the active nucleus in ESO\,420-G13. In order to compute the radio power we used two different methods that provide lower and upper limits. The lower limit is derived by fitting the radio-to-IR spectral energy distribution (SED), compiled from NED in the $843\, \rm{MHz}$ to $70\, \rm{\micron}$ range (Fig.\,\ref{fig_sed}; Table\,\ref{tab_sed}). The dust component was fitted using a modified black body \citepads{2012MNRAS.425.3094C}. Assuming that the synchrotron radiation from the nucleus dominates at low frequencies, this component was modelled using a broken power law with an exponential cut off \citep{R&L04}, which is in agreement with the ALMA fluxes for the radio core (open circles in Fig.\,\ref{fig_sed}, not included in the fit). Using a standard $\chi^2$ minimisation method, a minimum radio power of $10^{39}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ was found. The jet power, as computed from its radio emission, could be missing some of the energy deposited in a hot bubble that does pdV work. An estimate of the total mechanical power is obtained from the calibration by \citetads{2014ARA&A..52..589H} for a sample of $\sim 40$ radio galaxies, comparing the derived values of the work required to inflate the X-ray cavities observed in these galaxies with the monochromatic $1.4\, \rm{GHz}$ continuum flux of the nucleus (data from \citeads{2010ApJ...720.1066C}, \citeads{2008ApJ...686..859B}, and \citeads{2006ApJ...652..216R}). Following \citetads{2014ARA&A..52..589H} we use a normalisation factor of $f_{\rm cav} = 4$, and a $1.4\, \rm{GHz}$ flux of $65\, \rm{mJy}$ (\citeads{1998AJ....115.1693C}; Table\,\ref{tab_sed}) to estimate a total mechanical power of $\sim 4 \times 10^{42}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ in ESO\,420-G13. Therefore, the radio power differs from the wind kinetic luminosity by up to an order of magnitude, despite the wide range in the estimated jet power.

For a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} \sim 4 \times 10^8\, \rm{M_\odot}$ (see Section\,\ref{intro}), and an AGN luminosity of $L_{\rm AGN} = 0.5$--$1 \times 10^{44}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ --\,that is $10$--$20\%$ of the total IR luminosity based on the flux ratios of the mid-IR fine-structure lines observed by \textit{Spitzer}/IRS (\nev/\neii\ $= 0.10 \pm 0.01$ and \oiv/\neii \ $= 0.45 \pm 0.03$; \citeads{2016ApJS..226...19F}), the corresponding Eddington ratio is $\log(L_{\rm AGN}/L_{\rm edd}) \lesssim -2.7$. This suggests that the active nucleus is likely in the radio or kinetic mode, thus favouring the jet scenario. Notably, ESO\,420-G13 is not classified as radio-loud according to classical IR-to-radio flux ratios integrated over the whole galaxy ($q_{\rm IR} = 2.7$, radio-loud have $q_{\rm IR} \lesssim 1.8$; \citeads{2010MNRAS.402..245I}). Just considering the AGN contribution would lower $q_{\rm IR}$ to values in the $1.7$--$2.0$ range, thus the nucleus would be very close to the radio-loud domain if the radio emission is dominated by the AGN. Higher angular resolution observations ($< 1''$) at radio wavelengths are required to probe the jet morphology and constrain its power estimate.

\subsection{Other wind drivers}
How do we know that the wind is not triggered by AGN radiation? The AGN emission accounts only for $\sim 10$--$20\%$ of the galaxy's bolometric luminosity, that is $L_{\rm AGN} = 0.5$--$1 \times 10^{44}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. This is more than three orders of magnitude higher when compared to the X-ray luminosity, which could be instead dominated by star formation in the host galaxy (see Section\,\ref{intro}). In case the wind was driven by radiation pressure from the AGN, its distance from the generating mechanism would be higher than before, i.e. $\sim 600\, \rm{pc}$ ($2\farcs5$). Thus, the wind mass flow rate and momentum rate would be $2.3\, \rm{\msun\,yr^{-1}}$ and $2.3 \times 10^{33}\, \rm{erg\,cm^{-1}}$, respectively. This momentum rate does not exclude the AGN as a potential driving mechanism, considering the estimated radiation pressure of $L_{\rm AGN}/c = 1.7$--$3.7 \times 10^{33}\, \rm{erg\,cm^{-1}}$ and the momentum boosting that can be achieved during some phases of energy-driven expansion \citepads{2014A&A...562A..21C}. Still, in this scenario it would be hard to explain why the molecular gas rotating close to the nucleus is not blown away.

Regarding the radiation pressure from stars, no clear sign of a local starburst --\,such as excess emission in the dust continuum\,-- is detected near the outflow region. No significant excess of hot dust can be claimed either in the $12.8\, \rm{\micron}$ continuum image. Rather weak emission is seen in the $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ continuum map (see upper-left panel in Fig.\,\ref{fig_moments}), originating from three discrete knots in or near the area that the CO wind occupies. These regions all have comparable fluxes, in the $0.11$--$0.15\, \rm{mJy}$ range, contributing up to a total of $0.48\, \pm 0.08\, \rm{mJy}$. Even if all of the pertinent emission was originating from the cold dust instead of the jet-related synchrotron, none of these regions could produce more than $2.5\%$ of the total cold dust emission, which is equal to $6.1 \pm 0.3\, \rm{mJy}$. The corresponding infrared luminosity fraction is $2 \times 10^9\, \rm{\lsun}$ (as \lir \ for the entire galaxy is $8 \times 10^{10}\, \rm{\lsun}$). From \citetads{1998ApJ...498..541K}, this translates into a local star formation rate (SFR) of $0.3\, \rm{\msun\,yr^{-1}}$. Given that $\sim 100\, \rm{\msun}$ are needed for one supernova (SN) event to take place, the probability is very low for a SN to be responsible for this wind. Alternatively, a population of (young) stars cannot drive the wind either. The area comprising the CO wind occupies $4\%$ of the overall galaxy in the near infrared (JHKs 2MASS bands). The overall galaxy emission, which is comparable in the IR and in the optical bands and includes the AGN contribution, is $(5.8 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{44}\, \rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. The force exerted to the gas due to stellar radiation pressure, $L_{\rm stars}/c$, would then be as high as $7.7 \times 10^{32}\, \rm{erg\,cm^{-1}}$, significantly lower that the momentum rate of the gas ($1.4 \times 10^{34}\, \rm{erg\,cm^{-1}}$). Therefore, neither SNe nor stellar radiation can locally drive the wind.

\subsection{Further evolution of ESO\,420-G13}\label{evol}
For a mass outflow rate of $14\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ and a total molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm tot} = (3.07 \pm 0.02) \times 10^8\, \rm{M_\odot}$ (see Section\,\ref{results}), the depletion time would be of $\eta = M_{\rm tot}/\dot{M} = 23\, \rm{Myr}$ at the current outflow rate. However the outflowing gas would not likely escape the galaxy, falling again to the central part. Therefore, the result of this interaction points to a delay of the star formation instead of a quenching, while most of the feedback effect is expected in the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy. This is in line with the results from \citetads{2019MNRAS.483.4586F}. More violent AGN activity in the past would be required in order to explain the current evolutionary stage of ESO\,420-G13.

\section{Summary}\label{sum}

In this work we present a collimated molecular gas outflow detected in the CO(2--1) transition using ALMA interferometric observations of the central $3 \times 3\, \rm{kpc^2}$ in the Seyfert 2 galaxy ESO\,420-G13. The molecular gas outflow has a conical shape with $\sim 20\, \rm{pc}$ width at the closest point to the nucleus up to $200\, \rm{pc}$ width at the farthest point. It carries a molecular gas mass of $\sim 8 \times 10^6\, \rm{M_\odot\, yr^{-1}}$ at an average projected velocity of $160\, \rm{\kms}$, which translates into an outflow rate of $\sim 14\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. Based on the outflow structure and the energy and momentum balance, we conclude that this is a jet-driven wind powered by mechanical energy input from the AGN, becoming the second case after NGC\,1377 in which the presence of a previously unknown jet is revealed through its interaction with the ISM. However, in ESO\,420-G13 the molecular gas wind is detected very far from the AGN, at $340\, \rm{pc}$ (projected), traced only by \neii \ ionised gas emission at closer distances down to the nucleus. Two possible scenarios are proposed to explain the origin of such an outflow: \textit{i)} an outer molecular cloud originated by previous jet activity or a minor merger event, then impacted by the current jet, or \textit{ii)} a molecular cloud in the galaxy disc impacted by a jet, either propagating through the porous ISM or after a bent or a precession. The outflowing molecular gas detected will likely fall back into the galaxy, delaying instead of quenching the star forming process in the centre.

The case of ESO\,420-G13 proves that moderate-luminosity jets in non-powerful radio galaxies can still play a main role driving molecular gas outflows in these objects. Deep and high-angular resolution data for CO lines, radio wavelengths, and ionised gas are required to reveal the presence of these jets. In this context, the TWIST survey will provide a census of similar jet-driven outflows in nearby galaxies, allowing us to move from individual galaxy studies to a robust statistical analysis of these phenomena.

  abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black
holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of
the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance {$\Lambda$}
cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly
history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all
galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a
volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this
first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity
of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those
active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static
X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for
energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can
simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in
cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the
galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive
galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain
systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs
because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures,
and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst
feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself
requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might
explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological
`radio mode' model to be successful.

  abstract      = {In order to understand the physical mechanisms at work during the
formation of massive early-type galaxies, we performed six zoomed
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of haloes in the mass range 4.3
{\times} 10$^{12}$ {\le} M$_{vir}$ {\le} 8.0 {\times}
10$^{13}$ M$_{&sun;}$ at z = 0, using the Adaptive Mesh
Refinement code RAMSES. These simulations explore the role of active
galactic nuclei (AGN), through jets powered by the accretion on to
supermassive black holes on the formation of massive elliptical
galaxies. In the absence of AGN feedback, large amounts of stars
accumulate in the central galaxies to form overly massive, blue, compact
and rotation-dominated galaxies. Powerful AGN jets transform the central
galaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This
morphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies
is driven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due
to AGN feedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by
accretion. For galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of
stars deposited farther away from the centre increases, and galaxies
have larger sizes. The accretion is also directly responsible for
randomizing the stellar orbits, increasing the amount of dispersion over
rotation of stars as a function of time. Finally, we find that our
galaxies simulated with AGN feedback better match the observed scaling
laws, such as the size-mass, velocity dispersion-mass, Fundamental Plane
relations and slope of the total density profiles at z {\tilde} 0, from
dynamical and strong lensing constraints.

present-day stellar masses of M\_stel= 8.8 {\times} 10\^{}$\{$10$\}$-6.0 {\times}
10\^{}$\{$11$\}$ M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$. Using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations
with a pressure-entropy formulation that allows an improved treatment of
contact discontinuities and fluid mixing, we run three sets of
simulations of 20 haloes with different AGN feedback models: (1) no
feedback, (2) thermal feedback, and (3) mechanical and radiation
feedback. We assume that seed black holes are present at early cosmic
epochs at the centre of emerging dark matter haloes and trace their mass
growth via gas accretion and mergers with other black holes. Both
feedback models successfully recover the observed M$_{BH}$-{$\sigma$}
relation and black hole-to-stellar mass ratio for simulated central
early-type galaxies. The baryonic conversion efficiencies are reduced by
a factor of 2 compared to models without any AGN feedback at all halo
masses. However, massive galaxies simulated with thermal AGN feedback
show a factor of {\tilde}10-100 higher X-ray luminosities than observed.
The mechanical/radiation feedback model reproduces the observed
correlation between X-ray luminosities and velocity dispersion, e.g. for
galaxies with {$\sigma$} = 200 km s$^{- 1}$, the X-ray luminosity is
reduced from 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{- 1}$ to 10$^{40}$ erg
s$^{- 1}$. It also efficiently suppresses late-time star
formation, reducing the specific star formation rate from
10$^{-10.5}$ yr$^{- 1}$ to 10$^{-14}$ yr$^{- 1}$
on average and resulting in quiescent galaxies since z = 2, whereas the
thermal feedback model shows higher late-time in situ star formation
rates than observed.

  abstract      = {We study the population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their
effects on massive central galaxies in the IllustrisTNG cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The employed model for
SMBH growth and feedback assumes a two-mode scenario in which the
feedback from active galactic nuclei occurs through a kinetic,
comparatively efficient mode at low accretion rates relative to the
Eddington limit, and in the form of a thermal, less efficient mode at
high accretion rates. We show that the quenching of massive central
galaxies happens coincidently with kinetic-mode feedback, consistent
with the notion that active supermassive black holes cause the low
specific star formation rates observed in massive galaxies. However,
major galaxy mergers are not responsible for initiating most of the
quenching events in our model. Up to black hole masses of about 10\^{}$\{$8.5$\}$
M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$, the dominant growth channel for SMBHs is in the thermal mode.
Higher mass black holes stay mainly in the kinetic mode and gas
accretion is self-regulated via their feedback, which causes their
Eddington ratios to drop, with SMBH mergers becoming the main channel
for residual mass growth. As a consequence, the quasar luminosity
function is dominated by rapidly accreting, moderately massive black
holes in the thermal mode. We show that the associated growth history of
SMBHs produces a low-redshift quasar luminosity function and a redshift
zero black hole mass - stellar bulge mass relation is in good agreement
with observations, whereas the simulation tends to overpredict the
high-redshift quasar luminosity function.

transitions of OH for 24 local (z $\lt$ 0.262) ULIRGs observed with
Herschel-PACS as part of the Herschel ULIRG Survey (HERUS). Some OH 119
{$\mu$}m profiles display a clear P-Cygni shape and therefore imply
outflowing OH gas, while other profiles are predominantly in absorption
or are completely in emission. We find that the relative strength of the
OH emission component decreases as the silicate absorption increases.
This result locates the OH outflows inside the obscured nuclei. The
maximum outflow velocities for our sources range from less than 100 to
\~{}2000 km s$^{-1}$, with 15/24 (10/24) sources showing OH
absorption at velocities exceeding 700 km s$^{-1}$ (1000 km
s$^{-1}$). Three sources show maximum OH outflow velocities
exceeding that of Mrk231. Since outflow velocities above 500-700 km
s$^{-1}$ are thought to require an active galactic nucleus
(AGN) to drive them, about two-thirds of our ULIRG sample may host
AGN-driven molecular outflows. This finding is supported by the
correlation we find between the maximum OH outflow velocity and the
IR-derived bolometric AGN luminosity. No such correlation is found with
the IR-derived star formation rate. The highest outflow velocities are
found among sources that are still deeply embedded. We speculate that
the molecular outflows in these sources may be in an early phase of
disrupting the nuclear dust veil before these sources evolve into
less-obscured AGNs. Four of our sources show high-velocity wings in
their [C II] fine-structure line profiles, implying neutral gas outflow
masses of at least (2-4.5) {\times} 10$^{8}$ M $_{&sun;}$.

  abstract      = {We present an analysis of [O I]$_{63}$, [O III]$_{88}$, 
[N II]$_{122}$, and [C II]$_{158}$ far-infrared (FIR) 
fine-structure line observations obtained with Herschel/PACS, for 
{\tilde}240 local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) in the Great 
Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. We find pronounced declines 
(``deficits'') of line-to-FIR continuum emission for [N II]$_{122}$,
[O I]$_{63}$, and [C II]$_{158}$ as a function of FIR 
color and infrared luminosity surface density, {$\Sigma$}$_{IR}$. 
The median electron density of the ionized gas in LIRGs, based on 
the [N II]$_{122}$/[N II]$_{205}$ ratio, is n$_{e}$ 
= 41 cm$^{-3}$. We find that the dispersion in the 
[C II]$_{158}$ deficit of LIRGs is attributed to a varying 
fractional contribution of photodissociation regions (PDRs) to the 
observed [C II]$_{158}$ emission, 
f([C II]$_{158}$$^{PDR}$) = 
[C II]$_{158}$$^{PDR}$/[C II]$_{158}$, which 
increases from {\tilde}60\% to {\tilde}95\% in the warmest LIRGs. The 
[O I]$_{63}$/[C II]$_{158}$$^{PDR}$ ratio is tightly 
correlated with the PDR gas kinetic temperature in sources where
[O I]$_{63}$ is not optically thick or self-absorbed. For each 
galaxy, we derive the average PDR hydrogen density, n$_{H}$, 
and intensity of the interstellar radiation field, G, in units of 
G$_{0}$ and find G/n$_{H}$ ratios of {\tilde}0.1-50 
G$_{0}$ cm$^{3}$, with ULIRGs populating the upper end of 
the distribution. There is a relation between G/n$_{H}$ and 
{$\Sigma$} $_{IR}$, showing a critical break at 
{$\Sigma$}$_{IR}$$^{*}$ {\sime} 5 {\times} 10$^{10}$ 
L$_{&sun;}$ kpc$^{-2}$. Below 
{$\Sigma$}$_{IR}$$^{*}$, G/n$_{H}$ remains constant, 
{\sime}0.32 G$_{0}$ cm$^{3}$, and variations in 
{$\Sigma$}$_{IR}$ are driven by the number density of star-forming 
regions within a galaxy, with no change in their PDR properties. Above 
{$\Sigma$} $_{IR}$$^{*}$, G/n$_{H}$ increases rapidly 
with {$\Sigma$}$_{IR}$, signaling a departure from the typical PDR
conditions found in normal star-forming galaxies toward more
intense/harder radiation fields and compact geometries typical of
starbursting sources.

  abstract = {IRAS flux densities, redshifts, and infrared luminosities are reported
for all sources identified in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample
(RBGS), a complete flux-limited survey of all extragalactic objects with
total 60 {$\mu$}m flux density greater than 5.24 Jy, covering the entire
sky surveyed by IRAS at Galactic latitudes |b|$\gt$5{\deg}. The RBGS
includes 629 objects, with median and mean sample redshifts of 0.0082
and 0.0126, respectively, and a maximum redshift of 0.0876. The RBGS
supersedes the previous two-part IRAS Bright Galaxy Samples
(BGS$_{1}$+BGS$_{2}$), which were compiled before the final
(Pass 3) calibration of the IRAS Level 1 Archive in 1990 May. The RBGS
also makes use of more accurate and consistent automated methods to
measure the flux of objects with extended emission. The RBGS contains 39
objects that were not present in the BGS$_{1}$+BGS$_{2}$,
and 28 objects from the BGS$_{1}$+BGS$_{2}$ have been
dropped from RBGS because their revised 60 {$\mu$}m flux densities are not
greater than 5.24 Jy. Comparison of revised flux measurements for
sources in both surveys shows that most flux differences are in the
range \~{}5\%-25\%, although some faint sources at 12 and 25 {$\mu$}m differ by
as much as a factor of 2. Basic properties of the RBGS sources are
summarized, including estimated total infrared luminosities, as well as
updates to cross identifications with sources from optical galaxy
catalogs established using the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. In
addition, an atlas of images from the Digitized Sky Survey with overlays
of the IRAS position uncertainty ellipse and annotated scale bars is
provided for ease in visualizing the optical morphology in context with
the angular and metric size of each object. The revised bolometric
infrared luminosity function, {\phis}(L$_{ir}$), for
infrared-bright galaxies in the local universe remains best fit by a
double power law, {\phis}(L)\~{}L$^{alpha}$, with
{$\alpha$}=-0.6(+/-0.1) and {$\alpha$}=-2.2(+/-0.1) below and above the
``characteristic'' infrared luminosity
L$^{*}$$_{ir}$\~{}10$^{10.5}$L$_{solar}$,
respectively. A companion paper provides IRAS High Resolution (HIRES)
processing of over 100 RBGS sources where improved spatial resolution
often provides better IRAS source positions or allows for deconvolution
of close galaxy pairs.

Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer instrument to measure fluxes
for the [C II] 158 {$\mu$}m emission line. Sources cover a wide range of
active galactic nucleus to starburst classifications, as derived from
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon strength measured with the Spitzer
Infrared Spectrograph. Redshifts from [C II] and line to continuum
strengths (equivalent width (EW) of [C II]) are given for the full
sample, which includes 18 new [C II] flux measures. Calibration of L([C
II)]) as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator is determined by
comparing [C II] luminosities with mid-infrared [Ne II] and [Ne III]
emission line luminosities; this gives the same result as determining
SFR using bolometric luminosities of reradiating dust from starbursts:
log SFR = log L([C II)]) - 7.0, for SFR in M $_{&sun;}$
yr$^{-1}$ and L([C II]) in L $_{&sun;}$. We conclude that
L([C II]) can be used to measure SFR in any source to a precision of
\~{}50\%, even if total source luminosities are dominated by an active
galactic nucleus (AGN) component. The line to continuum ratio at 158
{$\mu$}m, EW([C II]), is not significantly greater for starbursts (median
EW([C II]) = 1.0 {$\mu$}m) compared to composites and AGNs (median EW([C
II]) = 0.7 {$\mu$}m), showing that the far-infrared continuum at 158 {$\mu$}m
scales with [C II] regardless of classification. This indicates that the
continuum at 158 {$\mu$}m also arises primarily from the starburst
component within any source, giving log SFR = log {$\nu$}L
$_{nu}$(158 {$\mu$}m) - 42.8 for SFR in M $_{&sun;}$
yr$^{-1}$ and {$\nu$}L $_{nu}$(158 {$\mu$}m) in erg
s$^{-1}$.

ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led
Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from
NASA.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a comparison between the optical spectroscopic
data and the incidence of compact radio emission for a sample of 60 warm
infrared galaxies. We find that 80\% of optically classified active
galactic nucleus (AGN)-type galaxies contain compact radio sources,
while 37\% of optically classified starburst galaxies contain compact
radio sources. The compact radio luminosity shows a bimodal
distribution, indicating two populations in our sample. The majority of
the higher radio luminosity class (L$\gt$10$^{4}$
L$_{solar}$) are AGNs, while the majority of the lower radio
luminosity class (L$\lt$10$^{4}$ L$_{solar}$) are starbursts.
The compact radio emission in the starburst galaxies may be due to
either obscured AGNs or complexes of extremely luminous supernovae such
as that seen in Arp 220. The incidence of optically classified AGNs
increases with increasing far-infrared (FIR) luminosity. Using FIR
color-color diagrams, we find that globally the energetics of 92\% of the
galaxies in our sample are dominated by starburst activity, including
60\% of galaxies that we find to contain AGNs on the basis of their
optical classification. The remainder are energetically dominated by
their AGNs in the infrared. For starburst galaxies, electron density
increases with dust temperature, consistent with the merger model for
infrared galaxies.

  abstract      = {We examine the detailed physics of the feedback mechanism by
relativistic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets interacting with a
two-phase fractal interstellar medium (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of
galaxies using 29 three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical
simulations. The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud
dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the
maximum size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to
their volume filling factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for
Eddington ratios P $_{jet}$/L $_{edd}$ $\lt$\~{}
10$^{-4}$, although systems with large cloud complexes $\gt$\~{} 50 pc
require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of 10$^{-2}$ to disperse
the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble expansion
rates in our simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions
resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a
multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume
filling factor of warm-phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud
complexes are smaller than \~{}25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the
dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure of the
high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow
that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase gas it has swept up, and
is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism
transfers 10\% to 40\% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas,
accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match
those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies
hosting powerful radio jets.

Observations provided low-resolution (R={$\lambda$} /$\{${$\Delta$} $\}${$\lambda$}
{\ap} 60-127) spectra over {\ap} 5-38 {$\mu$}m and high-resolution (R{\ap}
600) spectra over 10-37 {$\mu$}m. The Cornell Atlas of Spitzer/IRS
Sources (CASSIS) was created to provide publishable quality spectra to
the community. Low-resolution spectra have been available in CASSIS
since 2011, and here we present the addition of the high-resolution
spectra. The high-resolution observations represent approximately
one-third of all staring observations performed with the IRS instrument.
While low-resolution observations are adapted to faint objects and/or
broad spectral features (e.g., dust continuum, molecular bands),
high-resolution observations allow more accurate measurements of narrow
features (e.g., ionic emission lines) as well as a better sampling of
the spectral profile of various features. Given the narrow aperture of
the two high-resolution modules, cosmic ray hits and spurious features
usually plague the spectra. Our pipeline is designed to minimize these
effects through various improvements. A super-sampled point-spread
function was created in order to enable the optimal extraction in
addition to the full aperture extraction. The pipeline selects the best
extraction method based on the spatial extent of the object. For
unresolved sources, the optimal extraction provides a significant
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over a full aperture extraction. We
have developed several techniques for optimal extraction, including a
differential method that eliminates low-level rogue pixels (even when no
dedicated background observation was performed). The updated CASSIS
repository now includes all the spectra ever taken by the IRS, with the
exception of mapping observations.

earlier work, which was based on a smaller sample, that calls for two
distinct molecular gas components in general: (I) a cold component,
which emits CO lines primarily at J {\lsim} 4 and likely represents the
same gas phase traced by CO (1-0), and (II) a warm component, which
dominates over the mid-J regime (4 $\lt$ J {\lsim} 10) and is intimately
related to current star formation. We present evidence that the CO line
emission associated with an active galactic nucleus is significant only
at J $\gt$ 10. The flux ratios of the two [C I] lines imply modest
excitation temperatures of 15-30 K; the [C I] 370 {$\mu$}m line scales more
linearly in flux with CO (4-3) than with CO (7-6). These findings
suggest that the [C I] emission is predominantly associated with the gas
component defined in (I) above. Our analysis of the stacked spectra in
different far-infrared (FIR) color bins reveals an evolution of the SLED
of the rotational transitions of $\{$$\{$$\{$H$\}$$\}$$\}$$_{2}$$\{$$\{$O$\}$$\}$ vapor as a
function of the FIR color in a direction consistent with infrared photon
pumping.

  abstract      = {We investigate the correlation between far-infrared (FIR) and radio
luminosities in distant galaxies, a lynchpin of modern astronomy. We use
data from the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope
(BLAST), Spitzer, the Large Apex BOlometer CamerA (LABOCA), the Very
Large Array and the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in the
Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS). For a catalogue of BLAST
250-{$\mu$}m-selected galaxies, we remeasure the 70-870-{$\mu$}m flux
densities at the positions of their most likely 24-{$\mu$}m counterparts,
which have a median [interquartile] redshift of 0.74 [0.25, 1.57]. From
these, we determine the monochromatic flux density ratio,
q$_{250}$(= log$_{10}$
[S$_{250mum}$/S$_{1400MHz}$]), and the bolometric
equivalent, q$_{IR}$. At z \~{} 0.6, where our 250-{$\mu$}m filter
probes rest-frame 160-{$\mu$}m emission, we find no evolution relative to
q$_{160}$ for local galaxies. We also stack the FIR and submm
images at the positions of 24-{$\mu$}m- and radio-selected galaxies. The
difference between q$_{IR}$ seen for 250-{$\mu$}m- and radio-selected
galaxies suggests that star formation provides most of the IR luminosity
in $\lt$\~{}100-{$\mu$}Jy radio galaxies, but rather less for those in the mJy
regime. For the 24-{$\mu$}m sample, the radio spectral index is constant
across 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3, but q$_{IR}$ exhibits tentative evidence
of a steady decline such that q$_{IR}$ \~{} (1 +
z)$^{-0.15+/-0.03}$ - significant evolution, spanning the epoch of
galaxy formation, with major implications for techniques that rely on
the FIR/radio correlation. We compare with model predictions and
speculate that we may be seeing the increase in radio activity that
gives rise to the radio background.

(VLA) H I absorption and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) continuum
observations of the active-galactic-nucleus-(AGN-)driven molecular
outflow candidate NGC 1266. Although other well-known systems with
molecular outflows may be driven by star formation (SF) in a central
molecular disk, the molecular mass outflow rate of 13 M
$_{&sun;}$ yr$^{-1}$ in NGC 1266 reported by Alatalo
et al. exceeds SF rate estimates from a variety of tracers. This
suggests that an additional energy source, such as an AGN, may play a
significant role in powering the outflow. Our high spatial resolution H
I absorption data reveal compact absorption against the radio continuum
core co-located with the putative AGN, and the presence of a blueshifted
spectral component re-affirms that gas is indeed flowing out of the
system. Our VLBA observations at 1.65 GHz reveal one continuum source
within the densest portion of the molecular gas, with a diameter d $\lt$
8 mas (1.2 pc), a radio power P $_{rad}$ = 1.48 {\times}
10$^{20}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, and a brightness temperature T
$_{b}$ $\gt$ 1.5 {\times} 10$^{7}$ K that is most consistent
with an AGN origin. The radio continuum energetics implied by the
compact VLBA source, as well as archival VLA continuum observations at
lower spatial resolution, further support the possibility that the AGN
in NGC 1266 could be driving the molecular outflow. These findings
suggest that even low-level AGNs may be able to launch massive outflows
in their host galaxies.

reductions of archival data) in order to examine the spatial
relationship between the optical and radio emission. We confirm that the
radio and optical emission-line structures are consistent with weak
alignment at low redshift (z $\lt$ 0.6) except in the compact
steep-spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies where both the radio source and the
emission-line nebulae are on galactic scales and strong alignment is
seen at all redshifts. There are weak trends for the aligned
emission-line nebulae to be more luminous and for the emission-line
nebula size to increase with redshift and/or radio power. The
combination of these results suggests that there is a limited but real
capacity for the radio source to influence the properties of the
emission-line nebulae at these low redshifts (z $\lt$ 0.6). Our results
are consistent with previous suggestions that both mechanical and
radiant energy are responsible for generating alignment between the
radio source and emission-line gas.

  abstract      = {Over cosmic time, galaxies grow through the hierarchical merging of
smaller galaxies. However, the bright region of the galaxy luminosity
function is incompatible with the simplest version of hierarchical
merging, and it is believed that feedback from the central black hole in
the host galaxies reduces the number of bright galaxies and regulates
the co-evolution of the black hole and host galaxy. Numerous simulations
of galaxy evolution have attempted to include the physical effects of
such feedback with a resolution usually exceeding a kiloparsec. However,
interactions between jets and the interstellar medium involve processes
occurring on less than kiloparsec scales. In order to further the
understanding of processes occurring on such scales, we present a suite
of simulations of relativistic jets interacting with a fractal two-phase
interstellar medium with a resolution of two parsecs and a largest scale
of one kiloparsec. The transfer of energy and momentum to the
interstellar medium is considerable, and we find that jets with powers
in the range of 10$^{43}$-10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ can
inhibit star formation through the dispersal of dense gas in the galaxy
core. We determine the effectiveness of this process as a function of
the ratio of the jet power to the Eddington luminosity of the black
hole, the pressure of the interstellar medium, and the porosity of the
dense gas.

  abstract      = {We propose a `two-stage' model for the effects of feedback from a bright
quasar on the cold gas in a galaxy. It is difficult for winds or other
forms of feedback from near the accretion disc to directly impact (let
alone blow out of the galaxy) dense molecular clouds at \~{}kpc. However,
if such feedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse
interstellar medium (a relatively `easy' task), then in the wake of such
an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a combination of instabilities and
simple pressure gradients will drive the cloud material to effectively
expand in the direction perpendicular to the incident outflow. This
shredding/expansion (and the corresponding decrease in density) may
alone be enough to substantially suppress star formation in the host.
Moreover, such expansion, by even a relatively small factor,
dramatically increases the effective cross-section of the cloud material
and makes it much more susceptible to both ionization and momentum
coupling from absorption of the incident quasar radiation field. We show
that even a moderate effect of this nature can dramatically alter the
ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized and driven into a
secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of momentum
and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is
more than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has
been altered in this manner (and the `initial' feedback need only
initiate a moderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an
order of magnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a
host galaxy. Instead of \~{}5 per cent of the radiated energy (\~{}100 per
cent momentum) needed if the initial feedback must directly heat or
`blow out' the galactic gas, if only \~{}0.5 per cent of the luminosity
(\~{}10 per cent momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow,
this mechanism could be efficient. This amounts to hot gas outflow rates
from near the accretion disc of only \~{}5-10 per cent of the black hole
accretion rate.

in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Previous numerical studies have shown
that it is difficult to create such an outflow by accelerating existing
molecular clouds in the host galaxy, as the clouds will be destroyed
before they can reach the high velocities that are observed. In this
work, we consider an alternative scenario where molecules form in situ
within the AGN outflow. We present a series of hydro-chemical
simulations of an isotropic AGN wind interacting with a uniform medium.
We follow the time-dependent chemistry of 157 species, including 20
molecules, to determine whether molecules can form rapidly enough to
produce the observed molecular outflows. We find H$_{2}$ outflow
rates up to 140 M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$ yr\^{}$\{$-1$\}$, which is sensitive to density, AGN
luminosity, and metallicity. We compute emission and absorption lines of
CO, OH, and warm (a few hundred K) H$_{2}$ from the simulations in
post-processing. The CO-derived outflow rates and OH absorption
strengths at solar metallicity agree with observations, although the
maximum line-of-sight velocities from the model CO spectra are a factor
{\ap}2 lower than is observed. We derive a CO (1-0) to H$_{2}$
conversion factor of {$\alpha$} \_$\{$CO (1-0)$\}$ = 0.13 M\_$\{${\sun}$\}$ (K km s\^{}$\{$-1$\}$
pc$^{2}$)\^{}$\{$-1$\}$, 6 times lower than is commonly assumed in
observations of such systems. We find strong emission from the
mid-infrared lines of H$_{2}$. The mass of H$_{2}$ traced by
this infrared emission is within a few per cent of the total
H$_{2}$ mass. This H$_{2}$ emission may be observable by
James Webb Space Telescope.

from the nuclear and circumnuclear region with a two-arm nuclear spiral
extending {\tilde}10{\Prime} on each side. The circumnuclear CO(2-1)
kinematics can be fitted with a rotating disk, although there are
regions with large residual velocities and/or velocity dispersions. The
CO(2-1) line profiles of these regions show two different velocity
components. One is ascribed to the circular component and the other to
the interaction of the AGN outflow, as traced by the [O III]{$\lambda$}5007
{\AA} emission, with molecular gas in the disk a few hundred parsecs
from the AGN. On nuclear scales, we detected an inclined CO(2-1)
disk (diameter 26 pc, FWHM) oriented almost in a north-south
direction. The CO(2-1) nuclear kinematics can be fitted with a
rotating disk that appears to be tilted with respect to the large-scale
disk. There are strong non-circular motions in the central
0.{\Prime}2-0.{\Prime}3 with velocities of up to 110 km
s$^{-1}$. In the absence of a nuclear bar, these motions
could be explained as radial outflows in the nuclear disk. We estimate a
total molecular gas mass for the nuclear disk of M(H$_{2}$) = 1.1

density toward the location of the AGN of N(H$_{2}$) {\tilde} 5

CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor. We interpret this nuclear
molecular gas disk as the obscuring torus of NGC 5643 as well as the
collimating structure of the ionization cone.

the Very Large Telescope/SINFONI. We identify a region that is markedly
weak in low-excitation CO 2$\backslash$to 1 emission from cold molecular gas, but
appears to be filled with ionized and warm molecular gas, which
indicates that the AGN is directly influencing the properties of the
molecular material. Using multiple molecular gas tracers, we demonstrate
that, despite the lack of CO line emission, the surface densities and
kinematics of molecular gas vary smoothly across the region. Our results
demonstrate that the influence of an AGN on star-forming gas can be
quite localized. In contrast to widely held theoretical expectations, we
find that molecular gas remains resilient to the glare of energetic AGN
feedback.

observations of the nearby Compton-thick Seyfert galaxy ESO428-G14, with
angular resolution 0.7 arcsec (78 pc). We detect CO(2-1) emission from
spiral arms and a circum-nuclear ring with 200 pc radius, and from a
transverse gas lane with size of $\sim100$ pc, which crosses the nucleus
and connects the two portions the circumnuclear ring. The molecular gas
in the host galaxy is distributed in a rotating disk with intrinsic
circular velocity $v\_{rot}=135$ km/s, inclination $i=57$ deg, and
dynamical mass $M\_{dyn }=5\times 10^9~\rm M\_{\odot}$ within a radius of
$\sim 1$ kpc. In the inner 100 pc region CO is distributed in a
equatorial bar, whose kinematics is highly perturbed and consistent with
an inflow of gas towards the AGN. This inner CO bar overlaps with the
most obscured, Compton-thick region seen in X-rays. We derive a column
density of $\rm N(H\_2) \approx 2\times10^{23}~ cm^{-2}$ in this region,
suggesting that molecular gas may contribute significantly to the AGN
obscuration. We detect a molecular outflow with a total outflow rate
$\rm \dot M\_{of}\approx 0.8~M\_{\odot}/yr$, distributed along a
bi-conical structure with size of $700$ pc on both sides of the AGN. The
bi-conical outflow is also detected in the $\rm H\_2$ emission line at
2.12 $\mu$m, which traces a warmer nuclear outflow located within 170 pc
from the AGN. This suggests that the outflow cools with increasing
distance from the AGN. We find that the hard X-ray emitting nuclear
region mapped with Chandra is CO-deprived, but filled with warm
molecular gas traced by $\rm H\_2$ - thus confirming that the hard (3-6
keV) continuum and Fe K$\alpha$ emission are due to scattering from
dense neutral clouds in the ISM.

lobes in these systems have created visible cavities in the surrounding
hot, X-ray-emitting gas, which allow direct measurement of the
mechanical jet power of radio sources over six decades of radio
luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves. We find
that jet (cavity) power increases with radio synchrotron power
approximately as P$_{jet}$ \~{} L$^{beta}$$_{radio}$,
where 0.35 $\lt$= {$\beta$} $\lt$= 0.70 depending on the bandpass of
measurement and state of the source. However, the scatter about these
relations caused by variations in radiative efficiency spans more than 4
orders of magnitude. A number of factors contribute to this scatter,
including aging, entrainment, variations in magnetic field strengths,
and the partitioning of energy between electrons and nonradiating heavy
particles. After accounting for variations in synchrotron break
frequency (age), the scatter is reduced by {\ap}50\% , yielding the most
accurate scaling relation available between the lobe radio power and the
jet (cavity) power. Furthermore, we place limits on the magnetic field
strengths and particle content of the radio lobes using a variety of
X-ray constraints. We find that the lobe magnetic field strengths vary
between a few to several tens of microgauss depending on the age and
dynamical state of the lobes. If the cavities are maintained in pressure
balance with their surroundings and are supported by internal fields and
particles in equipartition, the ratio of energy in electrons to heavy
particles (k) must vary widely from approximately unity to 4000,
consistent with heavy (hadronic) jets.

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the growth of black holes through accretion
and bulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at the centers of
cooling flows. Most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the
intracluster medium (ICM) inflated by radio jets emanating from their
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present a new and extensive analysis
of X-ray cavities in these systems. We find that AGNs are energetically
able to balance radiative losses (cooling) from the ICM in more than
half of our sample. We examine the relationship between cooling and star
formation and find that the star formation rates are approaching or are
comparable to X-ray and far-UV limits on the rates of gas condensation
onto the central galaxy. The vast gulf between radiative losses and the
sink of cooling material, which has been the primary objection to
cooling flows, has narrowed significantly. Using the cavity (jet)
powers, we place strong lower limits on the rate of growth of the
central black holes, and we find that they are growing at an average
rate of \~{}0.1 M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$, with some systems
growing as quickly as \~{}1 M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$. We find a
trend between bulge growth (star formation) and black hole growth that
is approximately in accordance with the slope of the local (Magorrian)
relation between black hole and bulge mass, but the scatter suggests
that bulges and black holes do not necessarily grow in lockstep. Bondi
accretion can power the low-luminosity sources, provided the nuclear gas
density rises as \~{}r$^{-1}$ to the Bondi radius, but is probably
too feeble to fuel the most powerful outbursts.

2 galaxy NGC 1068 with NuSTAR, which provide the best constraints to
date on its $\gt$10 keV spectral shape. The NuSTAR data are consistent
with those from past and current instruments to within cross-calibration
uncertainties, and we find no strong continuum or line variability over
the past two decades, which is in line with its X-ray classification as
a reflection-dominated Compton-thick active galactic nucleus. The
combined NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift BAT spectral data set
offers new insights into the complex secondary emission seen instead of
the completely obscured transmitted nuclear continuum. The critical
combination of the high signal-to-noise NuSTAR data and the
decomposition of the nuclear and extranuclear emission with Chandra
allow us to break several model degeneracies and greatly aid physical
interpretation. When modeled as a monolithic (i.e., a single
N$_{H}$) reflector, none of the common Compton reflection models
are able to match the neutral fluorescence lines and broad spectral
shape of the Compton reflection hump without requiring unrealistic
physical parameters (e.g., large Fe overabundances, inconsistent viewing
angles, or poor fits to the spatially resolved spectra). A
multi-component reflector with three distinct column densities (e.g.,
with best-fit values of N$_{H}$ of 1.4 {\times} 10$^{23}$,
5.0 {\times} 10$^{24}$, and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$)
provides a more reasonable fit to the spectral lines and Compton hump,
with near-solar Fe abundances. In this model, the higher N$_{H}$
component provides the bulk of the flux to the Compton hump, while the
lower N$_{H}$ component produces much of the line emission,
effectively decoupling two key features of Compton reflection. We find
that {\ap}30\% of the neutral Fe K{$\alpha$} line flux arises from
$\gt$2{\Prime} ({\ap}140 pc) and is clearly extended, implying that a
significant fraction (and perhaps most) of the $\lt$10 keV reflected
component arises from regions well outside a parsec-scale torus. These
results likely have ramifications for the interpretation of
Compton-thick spectra from observations with poorer signal-to-noise
and/or more distant objects.

Spectra of these AGNs are presented as comparison standards for the many

The AGNs are NGC 4151, Mrk 3, I Zw 1, NGC 1275, Centaurus A, NGC 7469,
Mrk 231, and NGC 3079. These sources are used to demonstrate the range
of infrared spectra encountered in objects that have widely different
classification criteria at other wavelengths but that unquestionably
contain AGNs. Overall spectral characteristics, including continuum
shape, nebular emission lines, silicate absorption and emission
features, and PAH emission features, are considered to understand how
spectral classifications based on mid-infrared spectra relate to those
previously derived from optical spectra. The AGNs are also compared to
the same parameters for starburst galaxies such as NGC 7714 and the
compact, low-metallicity starburst SBS 0335-052 previously observed with
the IRS. Results confirm the much lower strengths of PAH emission
features in AGNs, but there are no spectral parameters in this sample
that unambiguously distinguish AGNs and starbursts based only on the
slopes of the continuous spectra.

fine-structure lines, rotational H$_{2}$ lines, and polycyclic

fluxes suggest molecular gas at a variety of temperatures. A simple

the [Ne V] 14.3 {$\mu$}m emission line, with a flux of
5{\times}10$^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, providing
the first direct detection of the buried active galactic nucleus (AGN)
in the mid-infrared. Modeling of the total spectral energy distribution
(SED) from near- to far-infrared wavelengths requires the presence of a
hot dust (T\~{}700 K) component, which we also associate with the buried
AGN. The small [Ne V]/[Ne II] and [Ne V]/IR flux ratios, the relative
fraction of hot dust emission, and the large 6.2 {$\mu$}m PAH equivalent
width (EQW), are all consistent with an apparent AGN contribution of
only 3\%-5\% to the bolometric luminosity. However, correcting the
measured [Ne V] flux by the extinction implied by the silicate optical
depth and our SED fitting suggests an intrinsic fractional AGN
contribution to the bolometric luminosity of \~{}20\%-24\% in NGC 6240, which
lies within the range implied by fits to the hard X-ray spectrum.

\caption{Transmission profile of the VISIR narrow-band filters NEII (grey line) and NEII\_2 (orange line). The \textit{Spitzer}/IRS high-resolution spectrum from \citetads{2015ApJS..218...21L} suggests that contamination from PAH emission is not present within the inner kpc (green-solid line, right axis). A blueshifted emission line with $-1000\, \rm{\kms}$ (dotted vertical line) would find the same transmission in both narrow-band filters, and therefore would not appear in the continuum-subtracted map. }\label{fig_ne2}

\caption{The ALMA CO(2-1) mean velocity map is compared to the extended \oiii \ line emission (green contours), the \textit{Herschel}/PACS IFU spectra for the [\ion{O}{i}]$_{\rm 63 \mu m}$ far-IR fine-structure line (square insets in the upper-left panel), the [\ion{O}{iii}]$_{\rm 88 \mu m}$ line (upper-right panel), and the [\ion{C}{ii}]$_{\rm 158 \mu m}$ line (lower panel). The optical datacube was taken from the Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey \citepads{2017ApJS..232...11T} and was aligned to the ALMA data assuming the peak of the stellar optical continuum to coincide with the unresolved $1.2\, \rm{mm}$ radio core. As shown by \citetads{2017ApJS..232...11T}, the \oiii \ emission morphology is asymmetric and extended along PA\,$\sim 30\degr$. Note the lower angular resolution of the PACS data ($9\farcs4 \times 9\farcs4$ per spaxel element, only the central and neighbouring elements from the $5 \times 5$ array are shown here. [\ion{O}{i}]$_{\rm 63 \mu m}$, [\ion{O}{iii}]$_{\rm 88 \mu m}$, and [\ion{C}{ii}]$_{\rm 158 \mu m}$ fluxes are in Jy (see scale in the left inset panel of the middle row), normalised to the value indicated in the upper left corner of each frame, to ease the comparison among different frames.}\label{fig_o3_c2} \end{figure}
